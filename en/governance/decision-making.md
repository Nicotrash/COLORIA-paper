# Decision Making

The decision-making process within the COLORIA DAO is carried out through a voting system based on the holding of NFTs and CLR tokens.

**To submit a proposal**, it is necessary to have a role within the DAO and own at least 5 Colorians and 1 T-Ring.

**To vote**, one T-Ring and one Colorian are required.

If a community member owns at least 3 Colorians, they can benefit from an additional vote. From 3 Colorians, their vote counts double.

Decisions are made according to the majority of votes cast.
