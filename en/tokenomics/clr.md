# CLR

CLR is the primary token used for all transactions and activities on the COLORIA platform, including the purchase of goods and services, and rewards for contributing to the COLORIA ecosystem.

CLR will be issued as a gToken, an "in-app" token developed by the Ternoa blockchain. In order to meet the growing demand from users, the decision to issue 30 million CLR was made to ensure sufficient availability of the token on the market.

CLR can be used to access exclusive features of the platform, such as purchasing NFTs, obtaining access rights to exclusive spaces, and participating in special events. CLR is a key element in the functioning of the COLORIA ecosystem, ensuring a smooth and sustainable internal economy.
