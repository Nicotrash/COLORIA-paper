# Revenue Generation

The revenue generation strategy for COLORIA is based on several pillars:

1. **Sale of NFTs**: NFTs will represent a significant part of COLORIA's economic model, and will serve both as a means of exchange on the platform, as well as products to sell to users.
2. **Sale of services**: COLORIA will also offer a range of services for users, such as creating custom 3D characters, developing custom games, and creating virtual environments for businesses. These services can be purchased with CLR.
3. **Advertising**: COLORIA will offer advertisers the opportunity to broadcast targeted advertisements to platform users. Users can be rewarded with CLR for their engagement with advertisements.
4. **Transaction fees**: COLORIA plans to levy transaction fees for purchases made on the platform. These fees will be in CLR and will be used to support the development and continuous improvement of the platform.

In terms of business strategy, COLORIA plans to focus on organic community growth, providing an exceptional user experience and encouraging user engagement. The company also plans to form partnerships with other players in the technology industry to enhance the reach of the platform and provide an even richer experience for users. Finally, COLORIA plans to invest in marketing and advertising to attract new users and strengthen brand awareness.
