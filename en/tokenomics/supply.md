1. **Ecosystem Fit**: By analyzing other similar projects in the NFT and metaverse ecosystem, we can see that similar or even larger offerings are often put in place. This ensures that the total supply of CLR is sufficiently significant to meet the needs of the community and support the goals of the COLORIA platform.&#x20;
2. **Adoption and Usage**: This total token offering encourages the adoption and usage of the COLORIA platform by providing sufficient token availability for users. This can also facilitate participation in community activities and reward programs, thus stimulating user engagement.&#x20;
3. **Future Flexibility**: Setting a relatively high maximum token supply allows for margin for adjustments and future evolution of COLORIA's tokenomics. This provides the possibility to adapt the supply and distribution of tokens based on the changing needs of the platform and its community as it develops.
