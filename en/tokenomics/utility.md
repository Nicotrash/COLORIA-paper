# Utility

The funds raised can be used to support the future development of the COLORIA platform, fund reward programs for token holders and artists/developers who contribute to the platform, and for the platform's operational costs.

The CLR will be used in COLORIA for various functions, including:&#x20;

* The purchase and sale of goods and services in the COLORIA metaverse.&#x20;
* Access to premium features, such as exclusive virtual objects, advanced gameplay experiences, and enhanced social features.&#x20;
* Participation in exclusive events in COLORIA.&#x20;
* Rewarding creators for their work and contribution to the COLORIA metaverse.&#x20;
* Voting for COLORIA governance decisions, allowing CLR holders to participate in important decisions regarding the development and direction of the platform.&#x20;

Therefore, CLR will be at the heart of the COLORIA metaverse economy, allowing users to take advantage of all the features of the virtual world and contribute to its development as a community.
