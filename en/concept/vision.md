# Vision

In COLORIA, our actions and decisions are guided by core values that we deem essential for creating a healthy and positive digital environment conducive to personal growth and development.

Our first core value is freedom of expression. Every individual should be able to express themselves freely, without fear of censorship or judgment. Thus, COLORIA is a space where imagination and creativity are encouraged, where new ideas are explored, and where everyone can be themselves.

Inclusion is our second cherished value at COLORIA. In our metaverse, every person deserves their place, regardless of their origin, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability. We are committed to creating a respectful environment, where everyone is valued and celebrated for their differences.

The third value that drives us is collaboration. We are convinced that cooperation and teamwork are necessary to achieve ambitious goals and create innovative projects. We thus encourage the creation of user communities and collaborative projects so that everyone can make their contribution to COLORIA and find their place.

Finally, responsibility is our fourth and final core value. We are aware of our impact on our users and the community as a whole. That's why we commit to making ethical decisions, protecting the privacy of our users, and preserving the digital environment in which we operate.

At COLORIA, we believe that these values are crucial to creating a healthy and positive digital environment, where everyone can freely express themselves, collaborate with others, and contribute to building a better world. We are committed to upholding these values in all our actions and making COLORIA a space where everyone can exploit their full potential.
