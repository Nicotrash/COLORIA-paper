# Presentation

COLORIA is an innovative metaverse based on the Ternoa blockchain, offering an immersive and engaging experience in a next-generation digital environment. It is a 3D virtual universe, in which users can explore a variety of different spaces, each with its own activities and possibilities.

The vision of COLORIA is to create a metaverse where users can freely express themselves, explore their creativity and imagination, and interact with a community of like-minded individuals. We believe the metaverse can be a platform for personal development, learning, and self-discovery, and we aim to create a digital space where these goals can be achieved.

Our metaverse is unique in that it is right-brain focused, and encourages creativity, imagination, emotion, and intuition. We believe these aspects are essential for a fulfilling life and we have created COLORIA to highlight them.

In COLORIA, Colorians can discover a variety of different zones, each with its own ambiance and activities. To enter COLORIA, there are two ways: owning one of the NFTs from the T-Ring collection or a T-Squad, each offering unique experiences. We believe COLORIA is the next evolution of virtual worlds, and we are excited to share this vision with you.

Join us in discovering a world where your right brain can freely express itself and the possibilities are endless.
