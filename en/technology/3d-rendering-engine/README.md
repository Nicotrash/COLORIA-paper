# 3D Rendering Engine

The 3D rendering engine is a key element of COLORIA as it enables the creation of an immersive and realistic virtual environment for users. We have chosen to use Unreal Engine, a high-quality 3D rendering engine developed by Epic Games. Unreal Engine provides advanced rendering, physics, and animation features, as well as high flexibility to create immersive and interactive experiences.
